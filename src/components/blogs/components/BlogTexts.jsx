        In the past, businesses wanted to have full control over all aspects of
        the software, and this is because they were used to adopting custom
        applications that ran on their own network. But such a technology
        approach leads to legacy applications that are difficult to use,
        maintain, and evolve. As a result, organizations now prefer to choose
        the best technologies on the market to compose a better and more
        performing product. And this is what composable architecture is all
        about. Let’s now delve into this approach to creating a technology

        everything you need to know about it.
